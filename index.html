<!-- This HTML file provides a simple example of a portfolio page. It contains a header, a few sections, and a few charts. -->
<!-- It works with the three css files in this folder: example1.css, example2.css and example3.css. -->
    <!-- The HTML file defines the structure of the page, and the CSS files define how it looks. -->
    <!-- The CSS examples are all designed to work with this page. Try swapping them out on line 29 and see what happens. -->

    <!-- HTML is heirarchial: tags like this define elements on the page. 
        Each tag does something different. For example:
            - The <html> tag defines the whole document.
            - The <h1> tag defines a large heading
            - The <p> tag defines a paragraph.

    <!-- The head tag links to resources our page needs and defines information about it. Tags in the <head> aren't displayed on the page. -->

    <!-- This is a link to a stylesheet which contains rules about how each element on the page should be defined-->

        This HTML file is a simple portfolio page based on the economics observatory training at ONS on the 22nd February 2024.
    </h3>

    <!-- We're organising the page into sections, with each section containing a chart, title and a description -->
    <section>
        <div class="chart-description">
            <h2>Section 1: A basic chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is a basic chart from the first economics observatory session.
            </p>
        </div>
        <figure id="Location1"></figure> <!-- we give it an id so we can put a vega-lite graph here with VegaEmbed -->
    </section>

    <section>
        <div class="chart-description"> <!-- we are grouping the title and description together so we can style them together -->
            <h2>Section 2: Another Chart</h2>
            <p> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                This is a more advanced chart. We'll cover charts like this in more detail later today. Don't worry if you don't understand it yet.
                Feel free to replace both charts with your own examples.
